An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a piece of software designed to make it easy to develop, build, and debug your programs.

A typical modern IDE will include:

- Some way to easily load and save your code files.
- A code editor that has programming-friendly features, such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, integrated help, name completion, and automatic source code formatting.
- A basic build system that will allow you to compile and link your program into an executable, and then run it.
- An integrated debugger to make it easier to find and fix software defects.
- Some way to install plugins so you can modify the IDE or add capabilities such as version control.

Some C++ IDEs will install and configure a C++ compiler and linker for you. Others will allow you to plug in a compiler and linker of your choice (installed separately).
