# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

The divide-and-conquer strategy solves a problem by:
1. Breaking it into subproblems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem
2. Recursively solving these subproblems
3. Appropriately combining their answers

The real work is done piecemeal, in three different places: in the partitioning of problems into subproblems; at the very tail end of the recursion, when the subproblems are so small that they are solved outright; and in the gluing together of partial answers. Recurrence relations are very important to calculation runtime in most DNC problems. [[Master Theorem]] can be used to solve most recurrence relations.

## Exponentiation (Using Karatsuba's Algorithm)

Inputting a number, we want the the exponentiated number from it.

```pcode
EXP(a, n:integer)
	if n=1 return a
	B = EXP(a, [n/2])
	if n is even return B*B
	if n is odd return B*B*a
```

Runtime: $a^{n},a^{\frac{n}{2},}, a^{\frac{n}{4},} \dots a^{1}$
$$T[n]= T\left[ \frac{n}{2} \right] + \Theta(M(n))$$
Where M(n) is time to multiply $2 - n$ digit numbers, say [[Integer Operations]]
By Master Theorem: $$T[n] = M(n) = O(n^{1.7})$$
## Binary to Decimal
Covert an array of bits to decimal representation of number as a sequence of digits.
Naive: $\Theta(n) \text{ additions} \rightarrow \Omega(n^2)$
Divide and Conquer Approach: 
- Split array into 2 halves.
	- $a_{L}, a_{R}$ 
- Recurse:
	- $d_{L}$ -> BinarytoDecimal($a_{L}$)
	- $d_{R}$ -> BinarytoDecimal($a_{R}$)
	- c => $EXP(2,n/2)$
- Combine:
	- Return $d_{L}*c + d_{R}$
Runtime:
$$T[n] = 2T\left[ \frac{n}{2} \right] + \text{Time to multiply}+\text{ Time to add}$$
$$T[n]=M(n)$$

## Closest Pair

$n$ points on a plane, find the closest pair. 

Naively, $\Theta(n^2)$

DNC approach:

Split the plane:

- Sort the points, $p_{1}, .. p_{n}$ in increasing x coordinate.
- Split sorted list in order to have split the list in 2 equal parts.

Recurse:
- Find closed on $S_left$
- and closest on $S_right$

Use than closest distance to only look at crossing lines that are at most d way from the line.

But if most or all points lie in the area, we can only look at the subregion which is opposite to the direction a point lies and look $d$ up and down. So a $d \times 2d$ region.

$$T[n] = O(n\log n)$$

### Solving Recurrences
Example 1: $T(n) = T(n-1) + \sqrt{n}$
(Unroll the recursion)

$$
T(n) = T(n-1) + \sqrt{n}
$$
$$
= T(n-2) + \sqrt{n-1} + \sqrt{n}
$$
$$
= T(1) + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \dots + \sqrt{n}
$$

- Each term $\leq \sqrt{n}$, so:
  $$
  T(n) \leq n \cdot \sqrt{n} = n^{1.5}
  $$

- Consider the last $\frac{n}{2}$ terms:
  $$
  T(n) \geq \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{n}{2} + 1} + \dots + \sqrt{n}
  $$
  $$
  \geq \frac{n}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}} = \frac{n^{1.5}}{2\sqrt{2}}
  $$

So:
$$
n^{1.5} \geq T(n) \geq \frac{n^{1.5}}{2\sqrt{2}}
$$

Example 2: $T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) + n$
(Unroll the recursion)
$$
T(n) = 2 \left[T\left(\frac{n}{3}\right)\right] + n
$$
$$
= 2 \left[ 2T\left(\frac{n}{9}\right) + \frac{n}{3} \right] + n
$$
$$
= 2^2 T\left(\frac{n}{3^2}\right) + 2 \cdot \frac{n}{3} + n
$$
$$
= 2^3 T\left(\frac{n}{3^3}\right) + 2^2 \cdot \frac{n}{3^2} + 2 \cdot \frac{n}{3} + n
$$
$$
= 2^k T\left(\frac{n}{3^k}\right) + \left( \frac{2^k n}{3^{k-1}} + \dots + \frac{2n}{3} + n \right)
$$
Let $k = \log_3 n$ (so $3^k = n$):
$$
T(n) = 2^{\log_3 n} + \Theta(n)
$$
$$
= n^{\log_3 2} + \Theta(n)
$$
$$
= \Theta(n)
$$


## Matrix Multiplication

For two $n \times n$ matrices, $X$ and $Y$, we want to compute $Z=XY$. To compute the entry $Z_{i,j}$,
$$
Z_{i, j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} X_{i, k} Y_{k, j}
$$
__Naive Approach__: Calculate $Z_{i,j}$ by calculating the inner product, which is $O(n)$. Then, their are $n^{2}$ entries in the matrix, so: $O(n^3)$. Using a [[Divide and Conquer|Divide and Conquer]] Strategy, divide the original matrices in 4 parts, int 8 $\frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2}$ matrices.

## Strassen's Algorithm
_Matrix-Multiply_ (X, Y : n Ã— n matrices)
- Think of $X, Y$ as a $2 \times 2$ array of $\frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2}$ matrices:
$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{bmatrix}, \quad
Y = \begin{bmatrix} E & F \\ G & H \end{bmatrix}
$$
- Matrix product $XY$:

$$
XY = \begin{bmatrix} AE + BG & AF + BH \\ CE + DG & CF + DH \end{bmatrix}
$$
- Compute matrix products (using recursion):
$$
P_1 = A(F - H), \quad P_2 = (A + B)H, \quad P_3 = (C + D)E
$$
$$
P_4 = D(G - E), \quad P_5 = (A + D)(E + H), \quad P_6 = (B - D)(G + H), \quad P_7 = (A - C)(E + F)
$$
- Output:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
P_5 + P_4 - P_2 + P_6 & P_1 + P_2 \\
P_3 + P_4 & P_1 + P_5 - P_3 - P_7
\end{bmatrix}
$$
