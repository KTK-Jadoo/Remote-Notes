Dynamic Programming is a very powerful algorithmic paradigm in which a problem is solved by identifying a collection of subproblems and tackling then one by one, smallest first, using the answers to small problems  to help figure out the larger ones, until the whole lot of them are solved.

__Approach__:

1) Define appropriate _subproblems_. 
	1) The largest one essentially solves the problem
2) Write a _recurrence relation_.
	1) With a base case
3) Determine _order_ of computation
	1)  Induces a DAG structure


Eg: Backpropogation

## Longest Paths in DAGs



## Longest Increasing Subsequence



## Edit Distance
