These last few topics are tough. I'd focus on conceptual understanding before tackling exam problems.

My approach: make a list of topics that you need to work on. For a single topic, review the textbook/lecture notes, clarify confusing points as soon as they come up (on Ed, in OH, or with other students), and work through any tricky discussion problems. Then, do (and redo) related exam problems until you consistently get the problems right. Move on to the next topic, and repeat.
