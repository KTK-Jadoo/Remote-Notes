1. **What does a SkyDeck Intern Scholarship mean for you financially?**

<br>

Receiving a SkyDeck Intern Scholarship would have a profound impact on my life. Being an international student from India, studying at UC Berkeley comes with a set of financial challenges, especially as I live off-campus and come from a single-parent household. My mother has always supported me, and the UWC Davis Scholarship I received has been a blessing. However, there are still significant living expenses, including rent, groceries, and transportation, which can quickly add up. This scholarship would offer much-needed financial relief and allow me to focus more on my studies and projects, rather than constantly worrying about making ends meet.

For me, this scholarship would mean more than just financial help. It would represent an opportunity to further explore my potential and dive deeper into the work that excites me. I’ve always had a passion for working on projects that have a real-world impact, like the time I developed a database system at Seva Foundation that streamlined processes across five continents. But balancing academics and finances has been challenging. With the SkyDeck scholarship, I could spend more time working on meaningful projects, such as AI-powered systems and data engineering solutions, rather than taking up side jobs just to pay the bills.

It would also give me the flexibility to invest in personal growth. I remember how overwhelmed I felt when I first left India for UWC Mostar, unsure of how I would fit in. But through that experience, I learned how to navigate unfamiliar territories and use my background as a source of strength. This scholarship would enable me to continue that journey of growth, making the most of my time at Berkeley and beyond.

2. **What impact do you think you can make to the SkyDeck startup?**

<br>

I believe I can bring both practical skills and a unique perspective to any SkyDeck startup. My background as an international student from India, combined with the technical expertise I’ve gained through my internships and personal projects, positions me well to contribute meaningfully to a startup’s growth.

In terms of technical skills, I’ve worked extensively with data engineering, machine learning, and automation. For example, during my internship at Seva Foundation, I built data pipelines from scratch, designed a PostgreSQL database, and integrated real-time Slack notifications to optimize team workflows. These experiences taught me the importance of building scalable, efficient systems—skills that I can apply to help startups solve complex technical problems, whether it’s managing data, improving workflows, or building innovative AI-powered solutions.

I’ve also led projects where I had to balance technical execution with a user-centered approach. One example is Scribble AI, where I developed an AI-powered tool to generate creative content for users. Handling thousands of users at once while maintaining the system’s performance required careful optimization and a focus on delivering an intuitive experience. This is the kind of balance I aim to strike in any project—building something that not only works well but is also meaningful and easy to use.

Additionally, having worked across different cultures and environments, I’ve developed strong communication and collaboration skills. At UWC Mostar, I was part of a global community that helped me learn how to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. I bring that same adaptability and openness to new perspectives to any team I join, which is especially important in the dynamic, fast-paced environment of a startup.
