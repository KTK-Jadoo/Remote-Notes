Dear Hiring Manager,

  

I am excited to apply for the **2025 Summer Intern - Data Analytics** position at Roche. With hands-on experience in data engineering, analytics, and automation, I am eager to contribute to Roche’s mission of advancing science to improve healthcare outcomes. My background in data science, combined with my passion for deriving actionable insights from complex datasets, aligns perfectly with this role.

  

At **Seva Foundation**, I designed and implemented PostgreSQL databases and optimized data pipelines using **dbt**, ensuring seamless data validation and cleaning across global datasets. I further enhanced team communication by integrating real-time pipeline updates with Slack. Additionally, during my tenure at **BLCK UNICRN**, I developed dynamic pricing models in **Python** and conducted market analyses to optimize subscription tier segmentation.

  

My project work, such as creating **Steam-lit**, a personalized game recommendation system, demonstrates my ability to utilize tools like **BERT**, **LDA**, and **Streamlit** to transform raw data into interactive user insights. Similarly, developing **Philosofy**, a debate simulator powered by **Llama 3.1**, reflects my proficiency in deploying scalable backend systems using **Flask** and integrating advanced NLP models.

  

I am confident that my technical expertise in **Python**, **SQL**, and data visualization tools such as **Tableau** and **Power BI**, along with my ability to communicate complex insights effectively, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to Roche’s data-driven initiatives.

  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Roche’s innovative work in healthcare and would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills align with your goals.

  

Sincerely,

**Kartikeya Sharma**
