Orlando, FL <br>

  

Dear Hiring Team,

  

I am thrilled to apply for the Labor Systems Internship with Disney Experiences. As a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science with a focus on Applied Mathematics, I am eager to combine my technical expertise and passion for data-driven decision-making to contribute to the innovation behind Disney’s legendary guest service.

  

My experience spans database design, data visualization, and web development, aligning perfectly with the responsibilities of this role. At Seva Foundation, I independently developed a PostgreSQL database and leveraged dbt to streamline reporting pipelines spanning five continents. This hands-on project not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of creating solutions that scale and empower users globally.

  

In addition, my recent project, _Massimo Fitness Tracker_, showcases my ability to integrate backend server management, frontend web design, and interactive dashboard creation into a seamless user experience. By utilizing Python, Flask, and TailwindCSS, I built a platform that tracks workout progress and generates actionable insights—skills that directly relate to the dynamic nature of the Labor Systems team.

  

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to contribute to Disney’s commitment to its Cast Members by developing and sustaining applications that optimize labor systems. I deeply admire Disney’s culture of innovation and its ability to create magical experiences through exceptional teamwork and technology.

  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and passion for Disney’s mission can contribute to the continued success of the Labor Systems team.


Warm regards, <br>
