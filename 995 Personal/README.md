Adam Tooze critically examines the concept of the “green energy transition,” challenging the dominant historical narrative that suggests societies smoothly transition from one dominant energy source to another (e.g., wood → coal → oil → renewables). Drawing on Jean-Baptiste Fressoz’s _More and More and More_, Tooze argues that energy transitions have never been clean breaks but rather processes of accumulation, where new energy sources supplement rather than replace older ones. He questions the feasibility of achieving net zero by 2050 within this historical and economic framework.

  

**Author’s Argument:**

  

Tooze argues that the idea of a linear transition to green energy is an illusion. Instead of a structured, staged replacement of energy sources, history reveals a pattern of **energy symbiosis**, where new forms of energy reinforce rather than displace older ones. He critiques the optimistic framing of energy transition by policymakers, economists, and technologists who assume that renewables will simply replace fossil fuels at the required speed. Instead, he contends that historical patterns and current developments—especially in China—suggest that fossil fuels will remain integral even as renewable energy expands.

  

The real challenge, according to Tooze (and Fressoz), is that a true energy transition would require a **deliberate, unprecedented suppression** of fossil fuel use, not just technological innovation. This contradicts the dominant transition theory, which assumes that economic growth and market forces will naturally guide a smooth shift away from fossil fuels.

  

**Sources of Evidence:**

• **Historical Case Studies:** Tooze and Fressoz show how past energy “transitions” (coal to oil, oil to renewables) were not true replacements but rather accumulations of multiple energy sources.

• **Contemporary Data on Energy Use:**

• More wood is burned today than ever before, even though we are supposedly in a post-wood era.

• Coal consumption remains high globally, especially in China, where coal-fired power plants are still being built.

• Renewable energy expansion is not leading to a reduction in fossil fuel use at a large scale, but rather an _addition_ to total energy consumption.

• **China’s Energy Policy:** The rapid deployment of renewables in China is not leading to a decline in coal usage. Instead, new coal plants are being built to ensure energy stability, highlighting the continued dependence on fossil fuels.

  

**Evaluation & Personal Response:**

  

Tooze’s argument is compelling in its challenge to mainstream optimism about energy transitions. His critique of the **linear progress model** is particularly convincing—historically, societies have not abandoned energy sources as new ones emerged but have instead layered them on top of each other. This suggests that the idea of a total, market-driven transition to renewables may be **more ideological than empirical**.

  

However, I have some reservations about the level of pessimism in this perspective:

• **Technological Innovation Could Change the Equation:** While historical patterns suggest energy accumulation rather than substitution, modern breakthroughs (e.g., advanced battery storage, nuclear fusion, or alternative materials for steel and cement) could alter this trajectory.

• **Policy Interventions Matter:** Tooze critiques market-driven optimism but does not explore the potential of aggressive regulatory measures, state-led investment, or new economic models (e.g., degrowth, carbon pricing) to reshape energy systems.

• **Global Disparities in Transition:** The piece is largely focused on Western and Chinese perspectives. However, countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia have different dynamics in energy use and transitions that could influence the overall trajectory in unexpected ways.

  

**Questions Raised:**

• **Is degrowth the only viable path to decarbonization?** If energy transitions are historically accumulative rather than substitutive, does this mean economic contraction is the only way to truly reduce emissions?

• **What role do alternative energy technologies (such as nuclear power or synthetic fuels) play in breaking the cycle of energy accumulation?**

• **How can policymakers and governments take a more proactive role rather than relying on markets to drive change?**

• **Does the critique of transition theory imply that net zero by 2050 is an impossible goal, or just that it requires a fundamentally different approach?**

  

Overall, Tooze’s analysis offers a powerful reality check on the challenges of energy transition. While his skepticism is valuable in countering overly simplistic optimism, a more detailed exploration of solutions—beyond just dismantling transition narratives—would further strengthen his argument.
