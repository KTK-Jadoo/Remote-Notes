# Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is the use of *(simulated)* **analog circuits** for information processing, where the parameters associated with the circuits are set using an **optimization algorithm** driven by **data**.

These circuits are typically **deep** in that information flows through multiple circuit elements before the output.

The goal is that the **learned circuit** has **approximately** captured the relevant patterns underlying the data used to train it, so that we can use this circuit to **solve problems involving new data** for which that pattern is relevant.
