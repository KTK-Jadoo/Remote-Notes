Given principal (P) and interest (r), let FV be the future value at  
time T (measured in years), then:  

- simple interest: FV = P(1 + r T )  
- compound interest: FV = P(1 + r )T (annually)   
- compound frequency: FV = P(1 + r /m)mT , m = 1, 2, 4, 12, 365  
- continuous compounding:  FV = P(1 + r /m)mT = PemT log(1+r /m) → PerT (m → ∞).  
- The effective annual rate with compound frequency m is re = (1 + r /m)m − 1. 
- The effective annual rate for continuous compounding is re = er − 1.
