An interest rate in a particular situation defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many different types of interest rates are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing rates, and so on. One important factor influencing interest rates is credit risk. This is the risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower. The extra amount added to a risk-free interest rate to allow for credit risk is known as a _credit spread_.

# Types of Interest rates

### Treasury Rates

- These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency.
- TSY bill $( ≤ 1Y )$, TSY notes $( 2Y - 10Y )$, TSY bonds ($20, 30Y$)
- It is usually assumed that there is no chance that the government of a developed country will _default_ on an obligation denominated in its own currency. 
- A developed country’s Treasury rates are therefore regarded as risk-free in the sense that an investor who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is certain that interest and principal payments will be made as promised.
- Credit risk free: Principal will be back.
	- Economic Risk: but what if inflation goes to 20%?

### Fed Fund Rate (Overnight Rates)

- Target interest rate set by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
- In the United States, the central bank is the Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) and the overnight rate is called the _federal funds rate_. 
- The weighted average of the rates in brokered transactions (with weights being determined by the size of the transaction) is termed the effective federal funds rate. 
- This overnight rate is monitored by the Federal Reserve, which may intervene with its own transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it. Other countries have similar systems to the United States.

### Repo Rate (Repurchase Agreement)

- A financial institution that owns securities agrees to sell the securities for a certain price and buy them back at a later time for a slightly higher price. The financial institution is obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the difference between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which they are repurchased. The interest rate is referred to as the _repo rate_.
- If structured carefully, a repo involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. 
- If the lending company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities keeps the cash provided by the lending company. 
- The most common type of repo is an _overnight repo_, where funds are lent overnight. However, longer-term arrangements, known as _term repos_, are sometimes used. Because it is a secured rate, a repo rate is theoretically very slightly below the corresponding fed funds rate. 


### Reference Rates

Reference interest rates are important in financial markets. The parties to transactions frequently enter into contracts where the future interest rate paid or received is uncertain, but will be set equal the value of an agreed reference interest rate.


#### LIBOR 

- is short for London Interbank Offered Rate. LIBOR rates have been compiled by asking a panel of global banks to provide quotes estimating the unsecured rates of interest at which they could borrow from other banks just prior to 11 a.m. (U.K. time). 
- Several different currencies and several different borrowing periods (ranging from one day to one year) were considered. The banks submitting quotes typically had good credit ratings. LIBOR rates were therefore considered to be estimates of unsecured borrowing rates for creditworthy banks. LIBOR rates have served as reference rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions throughout the world. 
- For example, the borrowing rate on a five-year loan in a particular situation might be specified as three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points (i.e., three-month LIBOR plus 0.3%). The value of three-month LIBOR would then be noted at the beginning of each three-month period and interest based on this LIBOR rate would be paid by the borrower at the end of the period. 
- A problem with LIBOR is that there is not enough borrowing between banks for a bank’s estimates to be determined by market transactions. As a result, LIBOR submissions by banks involved a certain amount of judgment and could be subject to manipulation. Bank regulators are uncomfortable with this and have developed plans to phase out the use of LIBOR. 

##### Replacements for LIBOR

The new reference rates are regarded as risk-free because they are derived from oneday loans to creditworthy financial institutions. LIBOR, by contrast, incorporates a credit spread. There is another important difference between the old and new reference rates. LIBOR rates are forward looking. They are determined at the beginning of the period to which they will apply. The new reference rates are backward looking. The rate applicable to a particular period is not known until the end of the period when all the relevant overnight rates have been observed.


### Reference Rates and Credit Risk

One problem faced by banks is that credit spreads in the economy increase in stressed market conditions. For example, the spread between three-month LIBOR and a threemonth rate based on overnight rates is usually about 10 basis points (0.1%), but it can be much higher in stressed market conditions. For example, it spiked to an all-time high of 364 basis points (3.64%) in the United States in October 2008 during the financial crisis. If a bank offers a loan at a reference rate plus x%, where x is a constant, it would like the rate to reflect ups and downs in average credit spreads. LIBOR, when used as a reference rate, did this, but the new reference rates (because they are essentially risk-free) do not. This has led banks to ask for a way of creating __risky__ reference rates by adding a credit spread to the new reference rates. There have been a number of proposals and the new risk-free reference rates may be augmented by credit spread measures in the future.



### Zero Rates

The $n$-year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for $n$ years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of $n$ years. There are no intermediate payments. The $n$-year zero-coupon interest rate is sometimes also referred to as the $n$-year spot rate, the $n$-year zero rate, or just the $n$-year zero.
