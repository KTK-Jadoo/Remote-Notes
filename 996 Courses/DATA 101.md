# Data Engineering

___Course Description___

This course will cover the principles and practices of managing data at scale, with a focus on use cases in data analysis and machine learning. We will cover the entire life cycle of data management and science, ranging from data preparation to exploration, visualization and analysis, to machine learning and collaboration.

The class will balance foundational concerns with exposure to practical languages, tools, and real-world concerns. We will study the foundations of prevalent data models in use today, including relations, tensors, and dataframes, and mappings between them. We will study SQL as a means to query and manipulate data at scale, including analytical challenges like sampling, aggregation and windowing, and performance concerns like views and indexes, data models, query processing and optimization, and transactions, all from a user perspective. We will study the foundations and realities of data preparation, including hands-on work with real-world data using standard Python and SQL frameworks. We will explore data exploration modalities for non-programmers, including the fundamentals behind spreadsheet systems and interactive visual analytics packages. We will look at approaches for managing the lifecycle of data science, including the establishment, monitoring, and maintenance of data pipelines for both analytics and machine learning. Time permitting, we will look at the specifics of ML pipelines including data validation, training, prediction serving and feedback loops, as well as technologies for representing, moving, sharing, and caching data including event streaming systems, key-value/document stores, in-memory and on-disk representation formats, log analytics, and search engines.
