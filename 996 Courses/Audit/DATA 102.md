# data, Inference, and Decisions

## Table of Contents

- Bayesian vs Frequentist
	- Frequentist: data ($y$) are random, unknowns ($θ$) are fixed
	- Bayesian: data ($y$) are random*, unknowns ($θ$) are random
	- Sounds simple, but has huge consequences!
    

- Parametric vs Nonparametric
	- Parametric
		- Make assumptions about relationship between unknowns ($θ$) and data ($y$)
		- Use assumptions to find $θ$ from $y$
	- Nonparametric: 
		- Don’t bother with assumptions
		- Find any good function $f$ so that $θ = f(y)$
		- (there’s another definition we’ll talk about later in the semester too)
