# Intro to Machine Learning

This class introduces algorithms for _learning_, which constitute an important part of artificial intelligence.

Topics include

- classification: perceptrons, support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian discriminant analysis (including linear discriminant analysis, LDA, and quadratic discriminant analysis, QDA), logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, boosting, nearest neighbor search;
- regression: least-squares linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, Lasso;
- density estimation: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);
- dimensionality reduction: principal components analysis (PCA), random projection; and
- clustering: _k_-means clustering, hierarchical clustering.
