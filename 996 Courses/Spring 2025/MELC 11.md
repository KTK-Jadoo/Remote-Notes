# Middle Eastern Worlds: The Modern Middle East

This course examines the cultural, intellectual, religious, and social developments of the Middle East from the time of the emergence of Islam in the 7th century to the modern day. The geography is broadly construed, spanning from the Maghreb in the West to Central Asia in the East. The course is interdisciplinary in nature, and takes as its primary subject the rich cultural, intellectual, literary, and religious sources and histories of the Middle East, as well as the violent ruptures introduced by colonialism, the visions and mechanisms of modernity and modernizing projects, and the contemporary crises of neoliberalism, revolution, and state and non-state violence. Current social and political developments in the region are understood both through their continuities with, and radical breaks from, a long and complex history of interaction between different cultural, religious, and linguistic communities. No prior coursework is required.
