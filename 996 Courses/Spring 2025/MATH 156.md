• Matrix decompositions (LU/QR/Cholesky/SVD), least squares problems, orthogonal matrices 
• Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Rayleigh quotients, generalized eigenvalues 
• Principal components, low rank approximation, compressed sensing, matrix completion 
• Convexity, Newton’s method, Levenberg-Marquardt method, quasi-Newton methods 
• Randomized linear algebra, stochastic gradient descent
