# Beyond the Data: Humans and Ethics

**_Course Description_**

This course provides an introduction to legal and ethical issues surrounding data and society, as well as hands-on experience with frameworks, processes, and tools for addressing them in practice. It blends social and historical perspectives on data with ethics, law, policy, and case examples to help students understand current ethical and legal issues in data science and machine learning. Legal, ethical, and policy-related concepts addressed include: the contingent and contextual nature of data; research ethics; privacy and surveillance; bias and discrimination; and oversight and accountability. These issues will be addressed throughout the lifecycle of data â€” from collection to storage to analysis and application. The course emphasizes strategies, processes, and tools for attending to ethical and legal issues in data science work. Course assignments will emphasize researcher and practitioner reflexivity, allowing students to explore their own social and ethical commitments.

Student Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of the course, students will be able to critically assess their own work and education in data science; to identify and articulate basic ethical and policy frameworks; and to understand the relationship between their work and ethical frameworks and legal obligations. Students will understand that the decisions data scientists and technologists make embed values and have political consequences that impact people, society, and the environment. Students will be able to describe and apply basic ethical and legal frameworks relevant to data science with data about humans. Students will understand that professional responsibility extends beyond legal compliance, and be able to use methods from the course to identify intended and unintended consequences of technical systems, and understand that technical solutions are one of many ways, including law and policy, to prevent or remediate harms. Students will be sensitive to the differential impact of technical systems on historically and traditionally marginalized groups, be familiar with technical and legal mitigations, and be able to articulate reasons for resisting, constraining, and embracing different uses of data science on these bases. Students will understand the contested and contextual nature of concepts including privacy, fairness, deception, discrimination, bias, and opacity. Students will be able to reflexively articulate critiques and/or justifications of their own work and education in data science. Students will have some understanding of workplace practices that can support reflection and action on social and political values.
